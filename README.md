## Heatmap

This folder contains the Jupyter notebook used to create a heatmap showing relative 
abundances of putative chemical classes that are differntially abundant across left and 
right armpit samples of all volunteers combined at all timepoints. Chemical classes are 
putative estimates retrieved through the [MolNetEnhancer](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1989/9/7/144) 
workflow and based on similarities in MS2 fragmentation patterns.
